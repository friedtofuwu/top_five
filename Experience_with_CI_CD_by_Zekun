Zekun Li: I have heard of CI/CD that its process is a circulation of continuous integration
          and continuous delivery/deployment. However, I haven't practically used it so far

Trevor Jarzynka:
          I have learned about CI/CD and messed around with Github Actions a little bit 
          but I am very inexperienced in it. This is something I want to learn more about because 
          it can streamline my development process.
